Detailed Description

The project focused on developing an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze the sales data of a store. The dashboard leveraged a combination of advanced Excel formulas and form controls to dynamically update and display key metrics.

**Key components of the dashboard included:**

- Top and Bottom 10 Products: Visual representations were created to showcase the top 10 best-selling products and the bottom 10 least-selling products, providing valuable insights into product performance.
- Customers with 10 or More Orders: A chart was developed to highlight customers who placed 10 or more orders, identifying the most loyal and valuable customers.
- Active and Inactive Customers: The dashboard included a section to display the number of active and inactive customers. Inactive customers were defined as those who had not placed an order in the last six months, providing a clear view of customer engagement levels.
- Monthly Sales Trend: A line chart was included to track the monthly sales trend, offering a visual representation of sales performance over time. This allowed for the analysis of sales patterns and the identification of any seasonal trends.
- The use of form controls, such as drop-down menus and buttons, enabled users to interact with the dashboard and filter data based on various criteria, enhancing the usability and customization of the analysis. This interactive approach allowed users to explore different aspects of the sales data and draw actionable insights.
